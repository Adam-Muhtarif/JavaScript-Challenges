1 => Task Id ✔

2 => If we not have tasks id will be 0
    else the id will ✔

3 => Problem with local storage if we
    reload the page and add new task the localStorage value be replaced with new task and delete all tasks before it ----fix it----  ✔

4 => When we adding new task do not
    overwrite the data in localStorage
    ----fix it---- ✔

5 => we can send the data in the page to save it in
     the localStorage ----fix it----

     the problem now is when we delete a task we also modify Id's of the all rest tasks
     so the arryOfTasks id's do not match the id's of the tasks on page
